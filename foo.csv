also, i think when students get something they didn’t expect to taste bad, they wouldn’t finish it, so maybe having food that’s less salty/oily but not to the point that it’s bland, might help.
lastly, increase the damn lunch durations. some people only have 30 min lunch (1h break in total) in a day packed with lessons. i think students will throw away less food if they’re given more time to finish it.

these are just my thoughts (as someone who doesn’t frequent the canteen at all), take the ideas with a pinch of salt yeaaaa"
